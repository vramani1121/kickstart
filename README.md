# kickstart
Real time kickstart website problem solved.
we faced issues that after accept the money, developers does not complete work.

how do i solved?
----------------
we created a Ethereum contract between Project manager and contributor. manager will assign spending request to contract.
if enough contributor which is more than 50% will accept and allow to do that, then provide raised fund. otherwise spending request will not get finalize.

how to setup our project in your desktop.
-----------------------------------------
- open terminal
- npm init -y
- npm install
- npm run dev
- search localhost:3000 on browser.
